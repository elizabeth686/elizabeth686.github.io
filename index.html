              <!-- write a paragraph explaining why your person is so great  -->
              <p>I think Selena was great because she made people belive on something they couldn't do. Selena was considerd the "Queen of Tejano," a type of Mexican that incorporated other styles, such as country and western. She also started singing when she was young and she grew up to be someone big. Sadly she past away at a young age becasue someone shot her.
